## Description

The goal of this software is to demonstrate a stochastic approximation algorithm 
for CoVaR and its gradient estimation, which is applicable in various complicated cases, 
including black-box and streaming data scenarios.

## Structure

The structure of this repository is as follows:
- `src/KBSA.py`: The code of the proposed kernel-based stochastic approximation (KBSA) algorithm.
- `scripts/`: The directory containing implementation examples.
- `results/`: The directory storing results for independent replications of the algorithm.
  - `results/figures/`: The directory storing the figures included in the paper.

## Requirements
The code is tested in the environment of python 3.12.4 with Windows 11.  

Numerous package requirements exist, including but not limited to: 
`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `operator`, `IPython`, 
`random`, `itertools`, `math`, `pickle`, `joblib`, `seaborn`, and `statsmodels`. 
For configuration details, please refer to the conda environment manifest file `environment.yml`.

To meet GitHub's file size limit, in the `results/` directory, raw output data files, 
e.g., `toy3.pkl`, are compressed and split. 
Please download, combine, and extract them into the `results/` directory, 
before previewing or analyzing them.

## Results
We provide detailed implementation guidances and demonstrate results 
in the `scripts/` directory. It suffices just to run each notebook (you can execute cells individually). 
We have generated all the data used in the paper——no external data sources are required. 
- `Toy_2D.ipynb` and `Toy_20D.ipynb`: The python notebooks containing implementation guidances
for reproducing the results in the **toy examples**;
- `portfolio_negative.ipynb` and `portfolio_positive.ipynb`: The python notebooks containing implementation guidances
for reproducing the results in the **nonlinear portfolio** example;
- `portfolio_allocate.ipynb`: The python notebook containing implementation guidances
for reproducing the results in the **portfolio asset allocation** example.

The following raw output data files are compressed and stored in the `results/` directory:
- `toy3.pkl` and `toy3_20d.pkl`: Estimates generated by the algorithm in the **toy examples**;
- `nonlinear6.pkl` and `nonlinear6_pos.pkl`: Estimates generated by the algorithm in the **nonlinear portfolio** example;
- `allocate_log70.pkl`: Estimates generated by the algorithm in the **portfolio asset allocation** example.

To meet GitHub's file size limit, more raw output data files, for robustness checks, 
are available and can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/15868830, including:
- `toy1.pkl` and `toy1_20d.pkl`
- `toy5.pkl` and `toy5_20d.pkl`
- `nonlinear3.pkl` and `nonlinear3_pos.pkl`
- `nonlinear9.pkl` and `nonlinear9_pos.pkl`
- `allocate_log50.pkl`
- `allocate_log90.pkl`
